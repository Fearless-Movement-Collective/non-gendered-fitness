# non-gendered-fitness

We are building the website for Non Gendered Fitness (NGF), who's purpose is to make health and fitness accessible to all Transgender and Gender Diverse (TGD) folks around the world.

Formally known as Fearless Movement Collective, NGF delivers inclusive and safe online fitness programs for TGD folks. We've been supporting our community since 2016 and are 100% gender diverse owned and operated.

We acknowledge that we work on the stolen lands of the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation. We are currently based in Naarm (also known as Melbourne, Australia).

Since changing our branding from Fearless Movement Collective to Non Gendered Fitness, we would like to redesign our current website, which is built using Wordpress, using the Divi theme and hosted with Hostgator. It's slow and clunky, SEO is not optimised for the right keywords, and we are starting completely from scratch.

Hi, my name is Zay Canters (they/them). I'm a white-passing, biracial, openly gender fluid person, who is able-bodied, educated, a survivor of trauma and born in Melbourne, Australia.

I am the co-founder of NGF, along with my partner Bowie Stover (they/them) who is our head fitness coach (who specializes in working with TGD folks and kettlebell training). Not only do we work specifically with the TGD community, we deliver allie-ship training and inclusion workshops for gyms, fitness trainers and physios.

Our current website (https:www/fearlessmovementco.com), is the first I've built with no prior knowledge to web dev.

Over the past 3 months, I've learnt about the JAMstack as well as learning basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm no expert, but I hope to design and build this website as a static site hosted on GitHub and I'm open to receiving as much help from TGD folks as possible.

If you are part of our wonderful TGD community and want to work on a project to help bring this incredibly important service to TGD folks around the world, i invite you to come join me on this project. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of funding for this project, but whatever help we receive we will be forever grateful!

We are just in the beginning of this project and would love all sorts of help and feedback. If you're looking for more information, please reach out and ask and I'd be happy to chat with you!
